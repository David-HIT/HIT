## A Passionate Undergrad of AISO~

My name is Jialin(Garin) He, "Jialin" is pronounced like "Garin", so call me Garin will be fine. My Chinese name is 何佳霖. “何” is the surname, and the given name"佳霖" means good rain after a long drought literally, which shows that my parents want me to be beneficial to the society, and that's exactly what I am passionate about.
